## notes

### What Is gRPC?

> gRPC is an open-source Remote Procedure Call framework that is used for high-performance communication between services.

> gRPC uses protocol buffers. Protocol buffers can describe the structure of data and the code can be generated from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.

### Field Numbers

Field numbers are used to **identify** your fields in the message binary format, and should not be changed once your message type is in use. Note that field numbers in the range **1 through 15** take **one byte to encode**, including the field number and the field's type (you can find out more about this in Protocol Buffer Encoding). Field numbers in the range **16 through 2047** take **two bytes**. **So you should reserve the numbers 1 through 15 for very frequently occurring message elements**.
